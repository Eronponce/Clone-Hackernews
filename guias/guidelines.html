                <strong> News Guidelines </strong> <br>

                <br> <strong> What to Submit</strong><br><br>
                On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and
                startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's
                intellectual curiosity.<br><br>

                Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting
                new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV
                news, it's probably off-topic.<br><br>

                <br><strong> In Submissions</strong><br><br>

                Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or saying
                how great an article is. It's implicit in submitting something that you think it's important.<br><br>

                Please submit the original source. If a post reports on something found on another site, submit the
                latter.<br><br>

                If the title includes the name of the site, please take it out, because the site name will be displayed
                after the link.<br><br>

                If you submit a video or pdf, please warn us by appending [video] or [pdf] to the title.<br><br>

                If the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective, we'd appreciate it if you'd crop it.
                E.g. translate "10 Ways To Do X" to "How To Do X," and "14 Amazing Ys" to "Ys." Exception: when the
                number is meaningful, e.g. "The 5 Platonic Solids."<br><br>

                Otherwise please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don't
                editorialize.<br><br>

                Please don't post on HN to ask or tell us something. Send it to hn@ycombinator.com.<br><br>

                Please don't delete and repost. Deletion is for things that shouldn't have been submitted in the first
                place.<br><br>

                Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to post your own stuff occasionally, but the
                primary use of the site should be for curiosity.<br><br>

                Don't solicit upvotes, comments, or submissions. Users should vote and comment when they run across
                something they personally find interesting—not for promotion.<br>
                <br> <strong> In Comments</strong><br><br>

                Be kind. Don't be snarky. Have curious conversation; don't cross-examine. Please don't fulminate. Please
                don't sneer, including at the rest of the community.<br><br>

                Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.<br><br>

                When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2,
                not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."<br><br>

                Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's
                easier to criticize. Assume good faith.<br><br>

                Eschew flamebait. Avoid unrelated controversies and generic tangents.<br><br>

                Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. A good critical comment teaches
                us something.<br><br>

                Please don't use Hacker News for political or ideological battle. It tramples curiosity.<br><br>

                Please don't comment on whether someone read an article. "Did you even read the article? It mentions
                that" can be shortened to "The article mentions that."<br><br>

                Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information, but please don't create accounts routinely. HN is a
                community—users should have an identity that others can relate to.<br><br>

                Please don't use uppercase for emphasis. If you want to emphasize a word or phrase, put *asterisks*
                around it and it will get italicized.<br><br>

                Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling, brigading, foreign agents and the like. It
                degrades discussion and is usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email hn@ycombinator.com and
                we'll look at the data.<br><br>

                Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story is spam or off-topic, flag it.
                Don't feed egregious comments by replying; flag them instead. If you flag, please don't also comment
                that you did.<br><br>

                Please don't complain about website formatting, back-button breakage, and similar annoyances. They're
                too common to be interesting. Exception: when the author is present. Then friendly feedback might be
                helpful.<br><br>

                Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring
                reading.<br><br>

                Please don't post comments saying that HN is turning into Reddit. It's a
                <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=926703">
